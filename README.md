## Project Full stack MERN : MongoDB, Express, React-Redux, Node


This app is an online store to find your futur web developer! On top of that, it is my resume ;-)

The user selects web developer skills he is looking for, then adds them to the shopping cart.
Once the user clicks on "Find my dev", the app searches in his database the best web developer who matches the user's selection.

Then the app displays the selected web developer's detailed profile. At this stage, the app also allows the user to contact the selected web developer through a contact form.
